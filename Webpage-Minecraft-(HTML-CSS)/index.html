				<h2>Rundown Of Minecraft</h2>
				<p>
				Minecraft is a widely popular game that almost everyone has heard of. Minecraft is a sandbox game meaning almost anything can be done in it as the limits 
				are the imagination and the amount of work you want to put into it. With it being a sandbox game people have had varying experiences some widely different 
				and some very similar to others.  To start talking about my experiences with minecraft I first need to talk about some key components of Minecraft and parts
				of its community. Minecraft has 3 main gamemodes, Survival, Creative, and Adventure all with varing abilities to do things. In survival mode players have to 
				deal with a health bar and a hunger bar while also fighting off mobs that spawn in the night. A player gathers resources from mining and trys to beat the game 
				by killing the Ender Dragon. Creative mode alows the players to use all the blocks in the game, grabing them from a menu, and the player can also fly. 
				This allows the player to build whatever they want with ease of movement and all the posible building supplies at their disposal.
 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section2">
				<p>
				In Adventure mode the players 
				still has to manage health and hunger just like in survival mode but they are unable to break blocks and do a few other key interactions. Using any combination 
				of these gamemodes people make servers or maps for other players to use or play on. Minecraft maps are things that people made and are used for anything from 
				showing off cool builds to having other players partake in a carfly crafted adventure. Minecraft servers are worlds that people made and decided to host using
				a 3rd party service allowing other people to join it and play together. Some servers stick to the core gameplay loop while others create custom experiences and
				mini-games allowing players to experience other types of gameplay in the same game. People will also sometimes play with additional features like plugins or mods.
				The main point of these are to add new things to Minecraft that are in the base game allowing for interesting experiences. 
				</p>

			<div class="section3">
				<p>
				One of the important parts of the community in relation to my experience would be the Minecraft Roleplay community. 
				This community uses minecraft to tell storys and act out characters for the enjoyment of being 
				part of a good story or putting on a good show for others to enjoy. Aspects of this community is what got me interested in more parts of minecraft as I watched content
				creators craft enjoyable storys.

				<h2>Working On Servers</h2>
				<p>
				I started working on a minecraft RP server called the Rift. I ended up join the server as a player waiting for it to come out but due to a staff shortage and 
				2 people I knew vouching for me I ended up getting invented to be a builder for the server.  From their I started to learn about the amount of time and resources 
				that needes to go into settingup and running a server. I spent my time connecting with the community and building things when asked to for the servers events. 
				These things helped me socialize more and get experience working with a team to get things done. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section5">
				<p>
				Unfortunately later on some drama between staff members lead to the team getting smaller along with a subsection of the players getting upset and distrustfull
				of the staff team thus starting a “Rebelion”. I ended up working on rebuilding bridges between the players and the staff team using the trust I got from constantly
				socializing with the players. It took a while but the rebelion ended up dieing out but the players would remain forever distrustfull of upper level staff. This
				gave me first hand experience as to how its hard to change peoples opinions for the better but how easy it is to break apart small communities. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section6">
				<p>
				Eventually I would endup making events for the Rift and with that I started learning more about storytelling and gameplay experiences. I needed to find ways to
				connect interesting gameplay and story with whats posible in minecraft on a strict schedule. Managing these events actually helped me enjoy writing more and also
				gave me experience in leading a small team of people. With the events going good I ended up getting promoted to Admin meaning I had the opportunity to make more
				impactful decisions. Unfortunately the players still had a distrust of staff so even though the players knew I was a good person they did not want to talk to me
				about the servers problems.
